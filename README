Ok this is my source for many photon kernels. Basically I started off with Shabby's source and ran with it. I use bash scripts because im lazy. I also use my own defconfig for ease of use and because i compile alot of kernels at once to test. To do this I have my defconfig load first then i run make menuconfig to make my changes. If I like the changes I edit the defconfig. Also only the posted source is of posted kernels.
